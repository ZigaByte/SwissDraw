# Swiss Draw

This is a repository with programs to run Ultimate Frisbee tournaments with Swiss Draw. The program uses linear algebra to approximate team strength based on all the played games so far. This program will be used in <b>Slovenian High School League - Å UL</b>. A similar system is used on tournaments such as Windmill Windup and G-Spot.
